Open ended project for Module 2 of CS2300 in Spring 2024.

This project features the Is-A relationship in C++. A racecar is a car. I have been seeing a lot of new about F1 racing and I've always been interested in cars so this seemed like a good fit for a project for me. This project features multiple topics from module 2 such as multiple inheritance, private inheritance, and the process of compiling a c++ program technically.

No known bugs currently

This program allows users to input info about a car or racecar they are looking to sell. This could be further advanced upon in future modules to connect to a website which could act as a log/collection of all of the cars put up for sale.
