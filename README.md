# M2OEP-chmooney
Open ended project for Module 2 of CS2300 in Spring 2024.

This project features the Is-A relationship in C++. A racecar is a car. This is an example of inheritance, where one class extends the other.

This program allows users to input info about a car or racecar they are looking to sell. This could be further advanced upon in future modules to connect to a website which could act as a log/collection of all of the cars put up for sale.
